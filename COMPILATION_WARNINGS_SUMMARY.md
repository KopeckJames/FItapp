# Compilation Warnings Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed âœ…
- **Core Data Sync Crash**: Fixed attribute name mismatches that were causing crashes
- **Method Name Conflicts**: Resolved conflicts between extension methods and Core Data generated properties
- **Syntax Errors**: Fixed malformed comments and Swift syntax issues

## Remaining Non-Critical Warnings

### Deprecated API Usage
- `onChange(of:perform:)` deprecated in iOS 17.0 - Use newer closure syntax
- `HKWorkout.init(activityType:...)` deprecated in iOS 17.0 - Use HKWorkoutBuilder
- `totalEnergyBurned` deprecated in iOS 18.0 - Use statisticsForType
- `dance` activity type deprecated in iOS 14.0 - Use specific dance types

### Code Quality Issues
- Unused variables that should be replaced with `_`
- Variables that should be `let` constants instead of `var`
- Unreachable catch blocks
- String interpolation with optional values
- Async/await usage warnings

### Swift 6 Language Mode Issues
- Main actor isolation warnings
- Capture of 'self' in closures that outlive deinit

## Recommendation

The critical crash issue has been resolved. The remaining warnings are mostly:
1. **Deprecated API usage** - Can be addressed in future updates
2. **Code quality improvements** - Non-blocking but good to clean up
3. **Swift 6 compatibility** - Future-proofing for newer Swift versions

The app should now compile and run without crashes. The user signup functionality should work properly.

## Priority

1. âœ… **HIGH**: Core Data crash - FIXED
2. ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Deprecated API warnings - Can be addressed later
3. ðŸŸ¢ **LOW**: Code quality warnings - Nice to have improvements
