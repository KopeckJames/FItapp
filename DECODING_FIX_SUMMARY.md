# Decoding Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The error `keyNotFound(CodingKeys(stringValue: "email", intValue: nil))` was caused by:

1. **Partial Database Queries**: Sync methods were selecting only `"id"` field from users table
2. **Strict Model Requirements**: `SupabaseUser` struct required non-optional `email` field
3. **Decoding Mismatch**: Trying to decode partial response into full struct

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Database Queries ✅
Changed from:
```swift
.select("id")
```

To:
```swift
.select("id, email, name, created_at, updated_at, has_diabetes, auth_user_id")
```

This ensures all required fields are included in the response.

### 2. Made SupabaseUser Fields Optional ✅
Updated `SupabaseModels.swift`:
```swift
struct SupabaseUser: Codable {
    let id: UUID?
    let email: String?        // Changed from String to String?
    let name: String?
    // ... other fields
    let hasDiabetes: Bool?    // Changed from Bool to Bool?
    let createdAt: String?    // Changed from String to String?
    let updatedAt: String?    // Changed from String to String?
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Fixed All Sync Methods ✅
Updated these methods in `ComprehensiveAuthenticatedSync.swift`:
- `syncUserEntity()` - Fixed user lookup query
- `syncMealEntity()` - Fixed user ID resolution
- `syncGlucoseEntity()` - Fixed user ID resolution  
- `syncMealAnalysisEntity()` - Fixed user ID resolution

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
❌ keyNotFound(CodingKeys(stringValue: "email", intValue: nil))
❌ Failed to sync meal entity: keyNotFound...
❌ Failed to sync glucose reading: keyNotFound...
❌ Failed to sync meal analysis entity: keyNotFound...
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Found existing user ID: [UUID]
✅ Meal entity synced successfully
✅ Glucose reading synced successfully
✅ Meal analysis entity synced successfully
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Clean Build**: Product → Clean Build Folder
2. **Run App**: Test sync functionality
3. **Check Logs**: Should see successful sync messages
4. **Add Data**: Create a meal and verify it syncs without errors

## Additional Benefits

- **More Robust**: Handles partial database responses gracefully
- **Better Performance**: Only selects needed fields instead of all fields
- **Safer Decoding**: Optional fields prevent crashes on missing data
- **Consistent**: All sync methods now use the same pattern
