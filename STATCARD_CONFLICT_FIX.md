# StatCard Redeclaration Fix

## Issue
The compilation was failing with the error:
```
Invalid redeclaration of 'StatCard'
```

## Root Cause
Multiple Swift files were defining their own `StatCard` struct:
1. `WorkoutSessionView.swift` - line 599
2. `ExerciseDetailView.swift` - line 441

This created a naming conflict when both files were compiled together.

## Solution
Renamed the `StatCard` in `WorkoutSessionView.swift` to `WorkoutStatCard` to avoid the naming conflict.

### Changes Made:

1. **Renamed the struct definition:**
   ```swift
   // Before
   struct StatCard: View { ... }
   
   // After
   struct WorkoutStatCard: View { ... }
   ```

2. **Updated all references in WorkoutSessionView.swift:**
   - 5 instances of `StatCard(` changed to `WorkoutStatCard(`
   - All functionality remains identical

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Move to shared component file**: Could create a common `StatCard` in a shared components file
2. **Use different names from the start**: Each view could have had unique names initially
3. **Use namespacing**: Could use module-level namespacing (more complex)

## Why This Solution

- **Minimal impact**: Only affects one file
- **Clear naming**: `WorkoutStatCard` clearly indicates its purpose
- **No functional changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Quick fix**: Resolves the immediate compilation issue

## Files Modified

- `FitnessIos/FitnessIos/Views/WorkoutSessionView.swift`
  - Renamed struct from `StatCard` to `WorkoutStatCard`
  - Updated 5 usage references

## Verification

The fix ensures:
- âœ… No naming conflicts between view components
- âœ… All StatCard functionality preserved
- âœ… Compilation should now succeed
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing code

## Future Recommendations

To prevent similar issues:
1. Use descriptive, unique names for view components
2. Consider creating a shared UI components library
3. Use consistent naming conventions across the project
4. Consider using Swift's access control to limit scope when appropriate

The workout system should now compile successfully! ðŸŽ‰
