# Dashboard Debug Fix

## Issue
The personalized dashboard is not showing user-specific content even after completing onboarding.

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check if PersonalizedHomeView is being used**: âœ… Confirmed in MainTabView
2. **Check if user profile is saved**: Need to verify during onboarding
3. **Check if dashboard generation is triggered**: Added debugging logs
4. **Check if dashboard is saved/loaded properly**: Added debugging logs

## Potential Issues

1. **User profile not saved during onboarding**
2. **Dashboard generation not triggered**
3. **Dashboard not saved to UserDefaults**
4. **App using cached old dashboard**

## Testing Steps

1. Complete a new user onboarding
2. Check console logs for dashboard generation
3. Use debug button to force regeneration
4. Verify user profile exists in UserDefaults

## Console Logs to Look For

- `ðŸŽ¨ PersonalizedHomeView.loadDashboard() called`
- `ðŸ“‹ Found user profile data in UserDefaults`
- `âœ… Successfully decoded user: [name]`
- `ðŸŽ¨ Generating personalized dashboard for: [name]`
- `âœ… Dashboard generated with X priority cards`

If these logs don't appear, the issue is in the data flow.
