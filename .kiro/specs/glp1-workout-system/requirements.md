# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive, clinically-optimized workout system specifically designed for users taking GLP-1 receptor agonists (Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, etc.). The system addresses the unique physiological challenges of GLP-1 therapy, including lean body mass preservation, side effect mitigation, and metabolic optimization during rapid weight loss phases.

The workout system will provide structured resistance training protocols, exercise modifications for medication side effects, and ML-ready categorization for personalized recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Exercise Database and Categorization

**User Story:** As a GLP-1 user, I want access to a comprehensive database of exercises specifically categorized for my medication needs, so that I can follow clinically-optimized workout routines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL populate a database with at least 50 exercises covering all major movement patterns
2. WHEN exercises are stored THEN each exercise SHALL include muscle groups, difficulty level, equipment requirements, and GLP-1-specific modifications
3. WHEN exercises are categorized THEN they SHALL be tagged with ML-ready attributes including intensity level, compound vs isolation, and side effect compatibility
4. WHEN exercises include form instructions THEN they SHALL provide detailed biomechanical cues and safety warnings
5. IF an exercise has GLP-1-specific modifications THEN the system SHALL store alternative versions for symptomatic days

### Requirement 2: 4-Day Upper/Lower Split Program Structure

**User Story:** As a GLP-1 user, I want a structured 4-day upper/lower split program that maximizes muscle preservation while respecting my limited recovery capacity, so that I can maintain lean body mass during weight loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses workout programs THEN the system SHALL provide a 4-day upper/lower split template
2. WHEN the program is displayed THEN it SHALL include Day 1 (Upper Push), Day 2 (Lower Quad), Day 4 (Upper Pull), and Day 5 (Lower Hinge)
3. WHEN exercises are prescribed THEN compound movements SHALL be prioritized at the beginning of each session
4. WHEN sets and reps are defined THEN they SHALL follow the 65-85% 1RM intensity guidelines with 8-12 rep ranges for compounds
5. WHEN session duration is calculated THEN it SHALL target 30-45 minutes to manage medication-induced fatigue

### Requirement 3: Progressive Overload and Load Management

**User Story:** As a GLP-1 user, I want the system to track my progress and automatically suggest load increases, so that I can achieve progressive overload while staying within safe parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the upper rep range for two consecutive weeks THEN the system SHALL suggest load increases (2.5-5lb upper body, 5-10lb lower body)
2. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL calculate and display weekly tonnage (sets × reps × load)
3. WHEN load recommendations are made THEN they SHALL consider the user's current side effect status
4. WHEN a user reports high fatigue or GI distress THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce intensity recommendations
5. IF a user consistently fails to complete prescribed reps THEN the system SHALL suggest load reductions

### Requirement 4: Side Effect Management and Exercise Modifications

**User Story:** As a GLP-1 user experiencing medication side effects, I want the system to automatically modify my workouts based on my current symptoms, so that I can maintain consistency despite fatigue, nausea, or other issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reports acute fatigue or dizziness THEN the system SHALL suggest reduced intensity alternatives (stopping before failure, shorter sessions)
2. WHEN a user reports nausea THEN the system SHALL recommend seated exercises and avoid movements requiring intense abdominal strain
3. WHEN a user reports joint pain THEN the system SHALL substitute high-impact exercises with low-impact alternatives
4. WHEN constipation is reported THEN the system SHALL emphasize aerobic components and suggest additional walking
5. IF multiple side effects are present THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most limiting symptom for modifications

### Requirement 5: Exercise Form and Safety Instructions

**User Story:** As a GLP-1 user, I want detailed form instructions and safety guidelines for each exercise, so that I can perform movements correctly and avoid injury during my compromised recovery state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an exercise is selected THEN the system SHALL display biomechanical cues and proper form instructions
2. WHEN compound movements are shown THEN breathing techniques including Valsalva maneuver SHALL be explained with safety warnings
3. WHEN exercises have cardiovascular contraindications THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warnings for users with hypertension
4. WHEN form breakdowns are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest form corrections or exercise modifications
5. IF an exercise requires spotting THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this requirement

### Requirement 6: ML-Ready Exercise Categorization and Data Structure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want exercise data structured for machine learning algorithms, so that the system can provide increasingly personalized workout recommendations over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exercises are stored THEN they SHALL include numerical attributes for ML processing (intensity score, complexity rating, recovery demand)
2. WHEN user interactions are logged THEN the system SHALL track completion rates, perceived exertion, and side effect correlations
3. WHEN exercise effectiveness is measured THEN the system SHALL store outcome metrics (strength gains, adherence rates, side effect frequency)
4. WHEN categorizing exercises THEN they SHALL be tagged with movement patterns, energy systems, and adaptation targets
5. IF user preferences are detected THEN the system SHALL weight exercise recommendations accordingly

### Requirement 7: Beginner to Professional Athlete Scalability

**User Story:** As a user with varying fitness experience, I want the system to provide appropriate exercise progressions and regressions, so that I can safely advance from beginner to advanced levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's fitness level is assessed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate starting loads and progressions
2. WHEN beginner modifications are needed THEN the system SHALL offer machine-based alternatives to free weight exercises
3. WHEN advanced progressions are appropriate THEN the system SHALL suggest technique refinements and load increases
4. WHEN exercise complexity increases THEN the system SHALL provide prerequisite movement assessments
5. IF a user demonstrates mastery THEN the system SHALL unlock more advanced exercise variations

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Health Data

**User Story:** As a GLP-1 user, I want my workout system to integrate with my medication tracking and health metrics, so that exercise recommendations can be personalized based on my complete health profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN medication data is available THEN the system SHALL adjust workout intensity based on injection timing and dosage
2. WHEN health metrics are tracked THEN the system SHALL correlate exercise performance with weight loss rate and body composition changes
3. WHEN side effects are logged THEN the system SHALL automatically modify upcoming workout recommendations
4. WHEN progress is measured THEN the system SHALL track lean body mass preservation metrics
5. IF health data indicates concerning trends THEN the system SHALL suggest medical consultation
